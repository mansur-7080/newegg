# Enhanced Product Service Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Product Service provides a comprehensive solution for product management in the UltraMarket e-commerce platform. This service is designed with enterprise-grade patterns and practices to ensure high performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Product Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation
- **Advanced Querying**: Filtering, sorting, pagination, and full-text search capabilities
- **High Performance**: Optimized SQL queries and multi-level caching
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error types with appropriate status codes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing measurements for performance analysis
- **Scalability**: Designed with high-volume transactions in mind

## Architecture

The Enhanced Product Service follows a layered architecture:

1. **Service Layer**: Business logic for product operations
2. **Data Access Layer**: SQL queries for interacting with the database
3. **Caching Layer**: Multi-level caching (memory and Redis)
4. **Validation Layer**: Input validation and error handling
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Performance metrics and logging

## Implementation Options

The service has multiple implementations to suit different requirements:

1. **enhanced-product-service-optimized.ts**: Pure SQL implementation for high performance
2. **enhanced-product-service-final.ts**: Prisma ORM-based implementation for type safety
3. **prisma-enhanced-product.service.ts**: Mixed approach with raw SQL when needed

## Core Methods

### Product Retrieval

- `getProducts(options?: ProductQueryOptions)`: Retrieve products with filtering and pagination
- `getProductById(id: string)`: Get a single product by ID
- `getProductBySlug(slug: string)`: Get a single product by slug
- `searchProducts(query: string, options?: ProductQueryOptions)`: Search products with text search

### Product Management

- `createProduct(data: ProductCreateData)`: Create a new product
- `updateProduct(id: string, data: Partial<ProductCreateData>)`: Update an existing product
- `deleteProduct(id: string)`: Delete a product

## Usage Examples

### Basic Product Retrieval

```typescript
const productService = new EnhancedProductService(cacheService);

// Get products with default pagination
const products = await productService.getProducts();
```

### Filtered Product Retrieval

```typescript
const products = await productService.getProducts({
  page: 1,
  limit: 20,
  sortBy: 'price',
  sortOrder: 'ASC',
  filters: {
    categoryId: 'category-123',
    minPrice: 10,
    maxPrice: 100,
    isActive: true,
  },
});
```

### Creating a Product

```typescript
const newProduct = await productService.createProduct({
  name: 'Premium Gaming Mouse',
  description: 'High-precision gaming mouse with customizable RGB lighting',
  sku: 'GAMING-MOUSE-001',
  price: 59.99,
  categoryId: 'category-123',
  brand: 'TechGear',
  tags: ['gaming', 'mouse', 'rgb'],
});
```

### Updating a Product

```typescript
const updatedProduct = await productService.updateProduct('product-123', {
  price: 49.99,
  isOnSale: true,
  salePercentage: 20,
});
```

### Searching Products

```typescript
const searchResults = await productService.searchProducts('gaming mouse', {
  filters: {
    categoryId: 'category-123',
    minPrice: 20,
  },
  sortBy: 'relevance',
});
```

## Error Handling

The service uses a custom `ProductError` class that provides:

- Descriptive error messages
- Error codes for programmatic handling
- Appropriate HTTP status codes

```typescript
try {
  const product = await productService.getProductById('invalid-id');
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ProductError) {
    console.error(`${error.code}: ${error.message} (${error.statusCode})`);
  } else {
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  }
}
```

## Caching

The service leverages the `AdvancedCacheService` for multi-level caching:

1. Memory Cache (LRU): For high-frequency requests
2. Redis Cache: For distributed caching across services

Cache keys are constructed with careful consideration of query parameters to ensure proper cache hits.

## Performance Considerations

- SQL queries are optimized for performance
- Caching is implemented strategically to reduce database load
- Batch operations use transactions for consistency
- Performance metrics are logged for monitoring

## Integration with UltraMarket

The Enhanced Product Service is designed to integrate seamlessly with other UltraMarket services:

- **Order Service**: For inventory updates and product availability checks
- **Cart Service**: For product information in cart operations
- **Search Service**: For advanced product search capabilities
- **Recommendation Service**: For related and recommended products

## Security Considerations

- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Parameterized queries protect against SQL injection
- Authorization checks ensure proper access control
- Rate limiting can be implemented at the API layer

## Extending the Service

The service can be extended with additional features:

1. Add new filtering options in the `ProductFilters` interface
2. Implement new sorting strategies in the `getProducts` method
3. Add specialized query methods for specific business needs
4. Integrate with analytics for personalized recommendations

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Performance Issues**: Check cache hit rates and query performance logs
- **Database Errors**: Ensure proper database connections and schema compatibility
- **Cache Inconsistencies**: Verify cache invalidation logic after updates
- **Search Limitations**: Check search implementation for full-text search requirements

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Product Service provides a robust foundation for product management in the UltraMarket platform. Its comprehensive features, performance optimizations, and extensible design make it suitable for enterprise-grade e-commerce applications.
