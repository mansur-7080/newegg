| DELETE | `/products/:id`                    | Delete a product                               |
| GET    | `/categories`                      | Get all categories                             |
| GET    | `/products/featured`               | Get featured products                          |
| GET    | `/products/new-arrivals`           | Get new arrival products                       |
| GET    | `/products/trending`               | Get trending products                          |
| GET    | `/products/related/:productId`     | Get products related to a specific product     |
| GET    | `/categories/:categoryId/products` | Get products by category                       |

## Caching Strategy

The service implements a sophisticated multi-level caching strategy:

1. **Memory Cache (L1)**
   - Ultra-fast in-process cache using LRU algorithm
   - Limited capacity but fastest access
   - Default TTL: 60 seconds

2. **Redis Cache (L2)**
   - Distributed cache for sharing between instances
   - Larger capacity and persistent
   - Default TTL: 1 hour

3. **Cache Invalidation**
   - Automatic invalidation on mutations
   - Pattern-based invalidation for related entities
   - Tag-based invalidation for collections

## Error Handling

The service implements comprehensive error handling:

- Custom `ProductError` class with error codes
- Structured error responses
- Circuit breaker for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

## Type Definitions

The service uses TypeScript for type safety with the following key types:

- `Product` - Core product entity
- `Category` - Product category entity
- `ProductCreateInput` - Data for creating products
- `ProductUpdateInput` - Data for updating products
- `ProductQueryOptions` - Options for querying products
- `ProductListResult` - Paginated product list result

## Performance Considerations

This implementation is optimized for performance in several ways:

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Selective field inclusion
   - Efficient filtering using database indexes
   - Pagination to limit result sizes

2. **Caching**
   - Multi-level caching to reduce database load
   - Cache warming for common queries
   - Intelligent cache invalidation

3. **Connection Management**
   - Connection pooling
   - Circuit breakers for dependencies
   - Health monitoring

## Migration from MongoDB to Prisma

This implementation represents a migration from MongoDB to Prisma with SQL. Key differences:

1. **Schema Definition**
   - Strongly typed schema with Prisma
   - Relationships are more explicit
   - Better validation at the database level

2. **Query Performance**
   - More efficient joins for related data
   - Better indexing capabilities
   - More predictable query performance

3. **Transaction Support**
   - Full ACID transaction support
   - Better data integrity guarantees

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. **GraphQL API**
   - Add GraphQL support alongside REST
   - Enable more efficient frontend data fetching

2. **Search Engine Integration**
   - Elasticsearch or Algolia for advanced search capabilities
   - Real-time indexing of products

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add detailed telemetry
   - Performance dashboards
   - Automated alerts for performance degradation

4. **A/B Testing**
   - Feature flags for new capabilities
   - Gradual rollout of changes

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Product Service with Prisma provides a high-performance, scalable solution for managing products in the UltraMarket platform. It's designed with performance, reliability, and developer experience in mind.
