## Critical Security Findings

### High Priority Issues

1. **Authentication Vulnerabilities**
   - JWT secret management needs improvement
   - Password policy enforcement missing
   - Session management vulnerabilities

2. **Input Validation Gaps**
   - Some endpoints lack proper validation
   - File upload security needs enhancement
   - SQL injection prevention incomplete

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Container security hardening needed
   - Kubernetes RBAC configuration gaps
   - Network security policies missing

### Medium Priority Issues

1. **Logging and Monitoring**
