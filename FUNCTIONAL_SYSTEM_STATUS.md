```bash
✅ Complete all missing services
✅ Full database integration  
✅ Complete frontend-backend connection
✅ Test mode payments
✅ Admin panel fully working

Result: Production-ready system
Time: 2 hours
```

### **Option B: Demo Version (30 minutes)**

## 💻 **CURRENT TEST STATUS**

### **Auth Service Test:**
```bash
# Running on port 3001
# Endpoints working:
POST /api/v1/auth/register
POST /api/v1/auth/login  
POST /api/v1/auth/logout
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh
GET  /api/v1/auth/profile
```

### **Frontend Test:**
```bash
# Web App: All pages loading
