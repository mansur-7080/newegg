# Production Code Quality Fixes - Next Steps

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. Console.log Replacement
- Replaced console.log statements with Winston logger
- Improved logging structure and security
- Enhanced production monitoring capabilities

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials Fix
- Replaced hardcoded passwords with environment variables
- Updated Docker Compose files
- Updated Jest setup files
- Generated production environment template

### 3. Environment Validation
- Enhanced environment validation utility
- Added comprehensive validation schema
- Improved error handling and logging

## ðŸ”§ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Update the generated .env.production file with real credentials
- Set up proper secrets management (Kubernetes secrets, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Configure environment variables in your deployment pipeline

### 2. Testing
- Run comprehensive tests to ensure all services work correctly
- Test logging functionality in production environment
- Verify environment validation works properly

### 3. Deployment
- Update deployment scripts to use environment variables
- Configure proper secrets management
- Test deployment in staging environment

### 4. Monitoring
- Set up proper logging aggregation (ELK stack, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Configure alerts for security events
- Monitor application performance
