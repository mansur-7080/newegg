## Usage Examples

### Using Authentication:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();
```

### Using Cart:
```typescript
import { useCart } from '../hooks/useCart';

const { cart, addToCart, removeFromCart } = useCart();
```

### Using Components:
```typescript
import { Button, Input, Card, Badge } from '../components/common';

<Button variant="primary" size="lg" loading={isLoading}>
  Submit
</Button>
```
