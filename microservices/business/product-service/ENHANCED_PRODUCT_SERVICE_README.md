# Enhanced Product Service

This service implements a high-performance optimized product service for the UltraMarket platform. It leverages SQL queries and multi-level caching to deliver exceptional performance for product catalog operations.

## Features

- Optimized SQL queries for maximum performance
- Two-tier caching strategy (LRU in-memory + Redis)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Complete TypeScript type safety
- Support for complex product filtering and search
- RESTful API with validation and security

## Architecture

The Enhanced Product Service follows a clean architecture pattern:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and validation
2. **Service Layer**: Contains core business logic and caching
3. **Data Access Layer**: Optimized SQL queries through Prisma

### Key Components

- **EnhancedProductService**: Core service with product operations
- **AdvancedCacheService**: Two-tier caching implementation
- **ProductController**: REST API handling
